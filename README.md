# RepliCat
 My first landing page, inspired by Blade Runner (1982). 
 It is for a fictional company called "The Siber Corporation" that sells cat like products.
 These products are much more intelligent and capable than you think. 
 At the top left of the page, the name of the company is displayed while across from it, is the logo.
 Clicking on this logo will make a "presale interest form" appear.
 Inside this form you will input your personal information and click on the item of interest. 
 At the center of the page, spaced apart from one another are the company's "hooks" to persuade you into purchasing the item. 
 
Hopefully I can make some type of video presentation of this landing page soon.
