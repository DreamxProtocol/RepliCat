# RepliCat

## What
 **RepliCat** is a landing page for the fictional company called ***The Siber Corporation***. The purpose of it is to inform the viewer of the company's products and to give the viewer a chance to join their mailing list. 

## Why
 This was made to demonstrate my capabilities of *HTML* and *CSS* by making a realistic buisness structured site with a fun movie theme.
 
## How
 The languages used to make this landing page were *HTML* and *CSS*. No *Bootstrap* was involved. All images used were made and editted using *GIMP* and *Inkscape*. Font used was downloaded from https://www.dafont.com/blade-runner-movie-font.font. 
 
## Page Description
 At the top left of the page you will find the company's name with a line of it's history underneath it. The center of the page highlights three features of the products with illustrations that correspond with them. At the top right of the page sits the company's clickable logo. Clicking the logo makes a form appear that ***would*** add the viewer to the company's mailing list and let them know which product variation you are interested in (*This is just a form and not a working feature*).
